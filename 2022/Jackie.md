Dragon-clicker App notes
Created the HTML & CSS file for the dragon clicker app. 
Disappointed I could not find a more stylish dragon icon. Also spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to add the clicks number and get it working. 
My first attempt had bugs in Javascript for it.  Very frustrating trying to fix it and not fully understanding what I was doing.

When adding 2nd dragon, I redid my code to match more of Jamies since it was too diffucult trying to do something similiar but different and remebering what did what.  
Felt better after this, but then had issues with my app showing on the live server.  Needed teacher help.

Created MVC files, when adding these my app is back to not shoiwng in the live server. 
Order is important with MVC files on the HTML file.  You want the model 1st, controller, then view
example: 
<script src="model.js"></script>
<script src="controller.js"></script>
<script src="view.js"></script>
