# dragon clicker reflections
•	Adding the second dragon provided a helpful visual of how aspects tie-in to the functionality of the event listener.  

•	The addition of the nav bar provide some clarity as well. I felt a bit confused about how the dragons would appear as the buttons were used. 

•	Moving to the MVC model has been helpful in making the code easier to work with. I can return to the project and more easily become reacquainted with the code & start working. I think it will be beneficial as a new learner to use separate files for each component as projects get more complex.
