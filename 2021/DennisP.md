# Reflecting on My Experience with Making a Dragon Clicker Application
## Dragon Clicker 0.1 



This was my Experience:
1. Dragon's Emojis are Unicode!!
2. Digital, not analog
3. Dragons are not dangerous

#### Are you happy with your method of duplication?
Yes. My method of duplication used the factory method. I passed three arguments as parameters to the dragonFactory function.

#### Is it scalable?
Yes, it is scalable, to an extent. I haven't implemented the factory function to include CSS such as hue-rotate().
