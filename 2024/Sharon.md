# Dragon Clicker Reflections

##First Steps
Once creating the single dragon clicker I had copied and pasted the same coding but was having trouble with the second dragon not counting the clicks. 
I decided to change the class and ids to  be unique to the second clicker. This fixed the issue.
I began trying to color them with fire/ice but was having trouble changing text emoji dragon. 
Research showed I was unable to change this, I began to utilize SVG image to have more control of the dragon image. This fixed the concern.
