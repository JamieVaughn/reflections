# Dragon Clicker Reflections

##First Steps Project
Once creating the single dragon clicker I had copied and pasted the same coding but was having trouble with the second dragon not counting the clicks. 
I decided to change the class and ids to  be unique to the second clicker. This fixed the issue.
I began trying to color them with fire/ice but was having trouble changing text emoji dragon. 
Research showed I was unable to change this, I began to utilize SVG image to have more control of the dragon image. This fixed the concern.

##Second Steps Project
// Below div is the recreating template for more dragons
           // <div class="dragon">Dragon<img src="imgDragon.svg" alt="" class="imgDragon"><div></div><span class="clicks"></span></div>
               // div has a dragon class and 2 elements: image and span
  **Used the above to create the additional dragons spawning and counting with Nav bar. Each section separated into .js, .html, .css file. References slides of previous classes, chatGPT, and mdn. 
        // created the button function
        // Limited the amount of creating dragons spawning
        // added loop for each button element
        // created the event to add more dragons
        // calculating dragon type based on current dragon count
        // created main element div for each dragon class type
        // creating the Dragon Element Text: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Light
        // creating clicks associated with dragon divs
        // adding the image to each div and click
        // add child elements to div: imange and span
        //   inserts into DOM after event button
